## 1. Introduction
This repository will discuss the build process and results of a Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Bot that automatically extracts and filters important data from PDF files using scraping techniques.

## 2. Build Process
This Robotic Process Automation (RPA) was created using [Uipath](https://www.uipath.com/) and uses [Adobe Acrobat](https://get.adobe.com/reader/) to open PDF documents. Using scraping techniques, the Robotic Process Automation (RPA) will retrieve data and enter it into a predefined Excel (ScrapedInvoiceOutput.xlsx). The data to be retrieved from the PDF are **Invoice Number**, **Invoice Date**, **Customer Name**, **Total Amount**, and **Customer ID**. The creation of the RPA can be seen in the following image:
