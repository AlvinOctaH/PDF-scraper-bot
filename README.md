# PDF-scraper-bot
An RPA bot that automatically extracts and filters important data from PDF files using scraping techniques. It will then input the filtered data into excel.

The data to be retrieved from the PDF are **invoice number, invoice date, customer name, total amount, customer ID**. The creation of the RPA can be seen in the following image:
